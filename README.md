# http-file-server
A node.js http file server without a framework

This project is a http based file server where files can be uploaded and deleted directly from the browser. It is built with Node.js without any framework, so it makes use of the low-level built-in http module and the powerful node.js streams which are the base of many widely used features like HTTP requests and responses objects, fs read and write streams or TCP sockets.
